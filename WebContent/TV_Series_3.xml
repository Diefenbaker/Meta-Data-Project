			Director (Toby
			Ziegler), deputy (Sam Seaborn),
			and press secretary (CJ Cregg). We
			follow these people through
			many political battles, as well as some

			personal sacrifice and the forced
			compromise of ideals and principles
			for tactical necessity and allows
			some insights into many aspects of
